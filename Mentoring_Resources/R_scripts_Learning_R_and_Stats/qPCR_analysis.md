Load in dataset

Expectation is that your dataset looks something like this, notice here
that there is a column that specifically says unique_name. This column
will help out in the analysis downstream. The column should include
something that will separate out your samples between the primers, in
this example it shows sample 6-TPI, because this row contains only the
data for sample 6 for TPI.

First thing to do is look at raw Cq values in a histogram

``` r
# plot raw Cqs, x is the Cq column, and the fill or color is by the primer type 
ggplot(Cq_values, aes(x= Cq, fill = primer)) + geom_histogram(position = "dodge")  
```

    `stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`. Pick better value with `binwidth`.

``` r
# if you want to also include another varaible to separate out the histogram by, you can include a facet 
ggplot(Cq_values, aes(x= Cq, fill = primer)) + geom_histogram(position = "dodge") + facet_grid(~treatment) 
```

    `stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`. Pick better value with `binwidth`.

With these you can look at general patterns in your data, and see if
there are any samples that look obviously different than others.

Because each sample gets 3 technical replicates for each primer, we want
to average the Cq values between the replicates. However we first want
to check to see how variable the values are between technical
replicates. If you are doing the same PCR reaction on the same amount of
sample 3 times, there really shouldnâ€™t be any difference in the Cq
value. But often times there is a difference, and it is ok if it is
small, but large variations can be an indication of an issue or
unreliable data.

Calculate the variances in Cq and the mean Cq between the qPCR
replicates

``` r
# for this example dataset we will only be going through the 1ng diluted samples
Cq_values <- Cq_values[which(Cq_values$dilution == "1ng"),]
# and because this removed some rows, we want to re-set the row numbers to be in order again
rownames(Cq_values) = NULL

# calculate variances in Cq value 
# use the variance function, and calculates the variance in Cq by the unique.name (each sample/primer has 3 Cq values to 
# calculate the variance by)
Cq_values$Cq_var <- ave(Cq_values$Cq, Cq_values$unique.name, FUN=var)
# this adds a column with the variances, however because there are 3 replicates for each sample/dilution, 
# there are all three columns retained. We want to keep those right now for calculating the mean Cq

# calculate mean in Cq value
# use the mean function, and calculates the mean of Cq values by the unique.name (each sample/primer has 3 Cq values to 
# calculate the mean by)
Cq_values$Cq_mean <- ave(Cq_values$Cq, Cq_values$unique.name, FUN=mean)

# but retained are 3 rows for every sample, and if we already averaged over them, the other two rows per sample are not necessary
# Keep all rows where the replicate is 1 (or you could do 2 or 3)
# make into new Df so we keep the original with all the Cq values
Cq_values_1rep <- Cq_values[which(Cq_values$replicate == "1"),]

# histogram of all variances
hist(Cq_values_1rep$Cq_var)
```

![](qPCR_analysis_files/figure-commonmark/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png)

``` r
# most are pretty low, and one sample is really high
# we probably want to remove the sample with the really high variance, or remove one of the technical replicates 
Cq_values[which(Cq_values$Cq_var >2),]
```

# for now we will keep this sample in the analysis
# but a sample like this would be something you would bring up with Rob and see if you should remove it or not from the analysis
```

You can also separate out your treatments, to see if there is a
treatment effect on the variance in Cq values

``` r
# is there a difference in variance between the two treatments?
# just poke
Cq_values_1rep_poke <- Cq_values_1rep[which(Cq_values_1rep$treatment == "16Cq DiNV needle poke"),]
# just inject
Cq_values_1rep_inject <- Cq_values_1rep[which(Cq_values_1rep$treatment == "16Cq DiNV injection"),]

# histogram of poke variances
hist(Cq_values_1rep_poke$Cq_var)
```

![](qPCR_analysis_files/figure-commonmark/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png)

``` r
# histogram of inject variances
hist(Cq_values_1rep_inject$Cq_var)
```

![](qPCR_analysis_files/figure-commonmark/unnamed-chunk-5-2.png)

``` r
# in this example, there seems to be slightly more variance in Cq value in replicate in the poked samples, than the injected samples
# but the difference is small 

# You can also check between plates, in this example half my samples were run on 1 plate, the other half on another
# separate out plate 1
Cq_values_1rep_plate1 <- Cq_values_1rep[which(Cq_values_1rep$plate == "1"),]
# separate out plate 2
Cq_values_1rep_plate2 <- Cq_values_1rep[which(Cq_values_1rep$plate == "2"),]

# histogram of plate1 variances
hist(Cq_values_1rep_plate1$Cq_var)
```

![](qPCR_analysis_files/figure-commonmark/unnamed-chunk-5-3.png)

``` r
# histogram of plate 2 variances
hist(Cq_values_1rep_plate2$Cq_var)
```

![](qPCR_analysis_files/figure-commonmark/unnamed-chunk-5-4.png)

``` r
#You can see here that there is a kind of large effect of which plate the samples were run on, the largest variance 
# for plate 1 was 0.06, but the largest for plate 2 1.2, with others at 0.6
```

Another way to explore your data is to look at how the mean Cq value and
the variance in the Cq values compare to each other

``` r
ggplot(Cq_values_1rep, aes(x=Cq_mean, y=Cq_var)) +
  geom_point(size=2, shape=23)
```

![](qPCR_analysis_files/figure-commonmark/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png)

In this polt you can really only see that one outlier sample, and all
others have low variance at any Cq value. What we have seen in other
experiments is that at the higher Cq values (close to 40) the variance
increases, and we think that is because of the machineâ€™s ability to
quantify the higher Cqs might not be as accurate.

Now that you have explored your data, we move on to analyze in it by
calculating the delta Cq. This is the difference in Cq value between
your control primer and your experimental primer. In this case, the
control primer is TPI, and the experimental primer is PIF3.

``` r
# currently the samples are not ordered by the sample, but by the plate, so I need each sample one right after the other
# alternating primers for this analysis to work 
head(Cq_values_1rep)
```
