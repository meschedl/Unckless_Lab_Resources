Looks like for sample 15 Myd88 RP49 supernatant, the variance is super
high. We looked and it seemed like just one replicate PCR was wrong, the
other two are very close to each other. This sample is row 62, so we
decided to remove row 62 from further analyses.

Check variances and means without row 62

``` r
#subset dataframe without row 62
Cq_data_without_62 <- Cq_data[c(1:61, 63:120),]

# make same dummy variable with new dataframe
x <- paste(Cq_data_without_62$sample_ID, Cq_data_without_62$primer, Cq_data_without_62$cell_type, Cq_data_without_62$sample_type, Cq_data_without_62$day, Cq_data_without_62$infected.)

# calculate variances in new dataframe 
variances_without_62 <- tapply(Cq_data_without_62$Cq, x, var)

# How does sample 15 Myd88 RP49 supernatant look now?
variances_without_62[which(variances_without_62 > 0.2)]
```

``` r
# that sample no longer has a worrying variance, good. 

# what are the Cq means for each sample_ID/primer/day/sample_type group?
means_without_62 <- tapply(Cq_data_without_62$Cq, x, mean)

# look at the means with a histogram
hist(means_without_62)
```

``` r
# want to plot the variances versus the means 
plot(variances_without_62~means_without_62)
```

``` r
# looks like the variances only increase to worrying levels with high means. Rob and I talked about this and for all of them except one (which has the lowest worrying variance), there either shouldn't be any detectable virus(not infected) or vely little (day 0). All of these are for the 115 primer. We are thinking that this level of variance is just what "no virus" looks like. So we will keep these for analysis. 
```

Now I need to reduce my dataframe to only include the means and
variances, which means every thrid line basically. Can I convert the
means and variances lists into their own dataframes?

``` r
# what is the variances thing?
class(variances_without_62)
```

    ## [1] "array"

``` r
# array

# transform array into df
variances_df <- as.data.frame.table(variances_without_62)
# this gives me a dataframe but the entire first column is all the variables 
# and the second column is the variances which it calls freq (not sure why)
# use dplyr to separate them out into separate columns 

# name all the columns I want 
variances_df_sep <- variances_df %>% separate(Var1, c('sample_ID', 'primer', 'cell_type', 'sample_type', 'day', 'infected'))
# check dataframe 
head(variances_df_sep)
```

``` r

```

    ##   sample_ID primer cell_type sample_type day infected        var

So I have a df with the variances, now I want the means in it as well

``` r
# going to transform the means array into a df
means_df <- as.data.frame.table(means_without_62)
# reaname the Freq column to mean

Starting with just cells, create an only cell dataframe and calculate
the delta Cq, then visualize

``` r
cell_means <- means_variances_of_Cq_df[which(means_variances_of_Cq_df$sample_type == "cells"),]
# Note that 115 Cqs are first in pairs of samples, the second is the cell control primer

This does not look good for my experiment. The highest amount of virus
is in the cells on day 0 of Dv-1. This shows basically no replication in
the Dv-1 cells, which should show some. This might mean the whole
experiment is just bad quality and I canâ€™t make any conclusions from it.

I still need to look at this information for supernatant though.

First look at supernatant and delta Cq for cell marker minus virus
marker - this is a virus per cell measure

``` r
supernatant_means <- means_variances_of_Cq_df[which(means_variances_of_Cq_df$sample_type == "supernatant"),]
# note here that the first row per sample is 115, the second is Lambda, and the third is the cell primer

# Separate that dataframe, incriminating by 3, every number between 1-24 
supernatant_means$means[seq(1,24,3)] # these are the 115 Cq means 
```

    ## [1] 31.61000 34.81667       NA       NA 29.68667 29.86333 31.44000 34.55333

``` r
supernatant_means$means[seq(2,24,3)] # these are the lambda primer Cq means

# make delta Cq for cell marker minus virus marker: subtract the 115 value from the control primer value 
delta_Cqs_sup_vir <- supernatant_means$means[seq(3,24,3)] - supernatant_means$means[seq(1,24,3)]

# use barplot to look at the delta Cq for each sample

This basically says that there is only DiNV DNA present in the day 0
supernatant for Dv-1 cells. This might make sense if no infectious virus
is produced. There should be a similar amount in the day 0 supernatant
for Myd88 cells, but there isnâ€™t in this plot. This indicates some
badness with my data.

Then look at supernatant and delta Cq for lambda primer minus virus
marker - this gives a measure of extraction control (because supernatant
may not have much cells/DNA)

``` r
# Separate that dataframe, incriminating by 3, every number between 1-24 
supernatant_means$means[seq(1,24,3)] # these are the 115 Cq means

This seems to show there is some variablitly of how my extractions went,
because the Lambda amount fluctuates, however if you look at the y axis
itâ€™s a pretty low scale.

Then look at supernatant and delta Cq for lambda primer minus cell
marker - this gives a measure of how many cells are in the supernatant

``` r
# Separate that dataframe, incriminating by 3, every number between 1-24 
supernatant_means$means[seq(1,24,3)] # these are the 115 Cq means

This makes sense that on day 5 there would be more cells in the
supernatant than on day 0 of the experiment. Actually the two infected
Dv-1s on day 5 are very consistant. The Myd88s are not. And the
non-infected is different as well. So there is considerable variability
here too.
