## Making and Running Agarose Gels


**Agarose gels are used to visualize DNA, usually after a PCR or other enzymatic reaction. DNA is loaded into wells in the gel and pulled through the gel matrix with a positive charge current. The DNA is stained and can be visualized with UV light. The size of gel will depend on the number of samples you want to run. The % of the gel will depend on the expected band size of the DNA to be looked at.**

**Note: Making and running gels require a DNA stain that is often mutagenic. It is an agent that intercalates into DNA to glow, but can also damage DNA. It is very important to wear gloves when working with gels. Additionally we visualize the stain with UV light. Always make sure the plastic cover is completely over the light box before turning it on. UV light also causes DNA damage.**

Gel sizes and specifications:
- Small square gel:
  - Maximum number of samples: 8
  - Number of ladder spaces: 1
  - Volume needed: 20mL
  - Volume gel stain needed: 0.5ul
  - How to cast: use casting trays, fit the base into the square spot
- Small rectangle gel:
  - Maximum number of samples: 24
  - Number of ladder spaces: 1
  - Volume needed: 30mL
  - Volume gel stain needed: 0.75ul
  - How to cast: use casting trays, fit the base into the rectangle spot
- Fisher tall rectangle:
  - Maximum number of samples: 14
  - Number of ladder spaces: 2
  - Volume needed: 40mL
  - Volume gel stain needed: 1ul
  - How to cast: Turn sideways in the gel box and slide down half way, using the rubber liners to make a seal. Use the level on top of the scale to make sure it is flat. Not pushing it down all the way makes it easier to take out
- Large rectangle (red stripes):
  - Maximum number of samples: 38
  - Number of ladder spaces: 2
  - Volume needed: 70mL
  - Volume gel stain needed: 1.5ul
  - How to cast: Use the black rubber bumpers to push in and seal the edges of the tray
- Largest clear rectangle:
  - Maximum number of samples: 96
  - Number of ladder spaces: 4
  - Volume needed: 165mL
  - Volume gel stain needed: 5ul
  - How to cast: Use lab tape to make a seal around the edges. Put tape along the sides and seal it very tight by pushing a fingernail along the tape multiple times until you feel like it is sealed properly

Making gels:
- Determine the % gel you need, usually 1-3%
- Determine the volume of gel liquid you will need to make
- Depending on the volume, you will need to make it in a certain sized erlymyer flask for best results:
  - 20-40mL: 125mL flask
  - 40-100mL: 250mL flask
  - 165mL: 500mL flask
- Based on the volume needed and the percentage gel, you can calculate the grams of agarose needed:
  - Ex. 100mL of a 1% gel needs 1g of agarose. So 40mL of a 1% gel needs 0.4g agarose. Or 70mL of a 2% gel needs 1.4g agarose
- Measure out the agarose in the fine scale using the weigh boat on the shelf and a scooper
- Fold the the weigh boat in half and pour the agarose into a dry erlymyer flask
- Measure the volume of 1X TAE needed for the liquid (the volume from above) in the 100mL graduated cylinder on the shelf
- Pour into the flask can swirl lightly to mix the agar and liquid
- Put in the microwave in the middle (microwave door is really hard to open)
- Press time/temp, 7 for the power, and 1 minute for the time
  - Note, the microwave time will vary depending on liquid volume and %. More liquid, it will need longer time. Higher percentage, it will need longer time. It is best to microwave in increments of 1 minute or 30 seconds
- Check after 1 minute and swirl gently to mix using a paper towel as a heat guard. The liquid needs to become clear, and boil a little. It also needs to be free of "chips" in the agarose that haven't fully dissolved. Chips look like clear little squares floating in the liquid, you might have to look hard to see them
- Keep microwaving and checking if you gel needs it. You don't want to have it microwave for too long because it could over-boil/you could loose too much volume to evaporation
- After it is melted properly, you want to wait a little to pour it so it's not too hot and warps the plastic. The time to wait depends, if using the 125mL flask, wait ~1min. If using 250mL flaks wait ~3-5 min. If using the 500mL flask wait 5-10 min
- In this time set up the casting set up
- Before pouring, add the appropriate amount of gel stain (kept in the 4 degree, make sure it is in liquid form) to the liquid in the flask and swirl it gently to mix
- Gently pour the liquid into the casting tray, trying to avoid bubbles
- Put the combs in and make sure it is sitting in evenly
- If there are obvious bubbles, use a pipette tip to move them to the side or the bottom of the tray
- Immediately wash the flask in tap water, then in DI water
- Wait 10-15 minutes for it to solidify

Loading the gel
- Gently take out the combs vertically and rinse them in DI water and place to dry
- Take the tray out of the casting device/remove tape
- Fully submerge the gel in the gel box in 1X TAE. If it is not fully submerged, add more 1X TAE until it is. Make sure the wells are on the side of the box with the black electrode
- Load 3ul of ladder (Gene ruler 1kb plus ladder) into the first well
- Load in samples in a **known order**, putting in other ladders if necessary
- Close the lid of the gel box
- Plug it into one of the power stations with colors matching
- Change the time and voltage settings if needed, or if using the other one make sure it is on 100V and set yourself a timer for when you want to turn it off
- After starting the power station, make sure you can see bubbles going inside the gel box

Imaging the gel
- Make sure the power station is in off mode before unplugging the wires
- Take the tray out of the gel box and take to the imager
- Slide the gel onto the imager without touching it
- Rinse the tray in DI water and place to dry, and cover the gel box again
- Use a second layer of gloves to put the plastic cover over the light box (etbr contaiminated)
- It's easiest to take off one of the outer gloves and have that hand free to touch other things safely
- Turn out the lights with free hand
- Turn on the UV light with the extra glove hand and take a picture on your phone with the free hand
- Turn off the UV light, take off the cover and place the gel in the gel trash bucket
- Rinse the light box with DI water and wipe with a paper towel - put that trash in the second trash bucket along with the outer pair of gloves
