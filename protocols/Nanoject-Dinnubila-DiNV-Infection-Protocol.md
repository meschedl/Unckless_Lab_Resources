## General Protocol for Infecting _D. innubila_ with 27.6nL of DiNV Solution

This protocol is designed to walk you through using the Drummond Nanoject II nanoinjector for infecting _D. innubila_ flies with 27.6nL of fluid. This protocol has not been tested on other species of _Drosophila_ or with other volumes of injection fluid and my need to be modified. 


### Planning  beforehand

- It's best to have a plan beforehand of how many flies you plan to infect, how many to use for control, etc
- When learning how to infect flies, it can be good practice to do a lot of control flies, however when doing actual experiments, having about 1/3rd the amount of control flies as compared to infection flies is acceptable
- However if you have a lot of conditions to test, you will need a lot of control flies 
- Always plan to do at least 2 replicate infections (or more, depending on how many replicate vials you make) for ever experiment (replicate blocks)
- Flies should be aged 5-7 days to be used for infecting, a day or two older is ok but not younger
    - This is especially important if you are using mated females. Because _D. innubila_ take a while to reproduce, we want to wait until they are probably 5-6 days post emergence to know they havae mated. For unmated flies, you will have to separate them out right after they emerged and keep them separate from males
- _D. innubila_ flies after infections go on regular mushroom food
- Once you have picked a time to infect (either morning or afternoon), it is best to always stay with the same time. You can have varying poking ability at different times in the day, and it needs to be consistant throughout infections. 
    - Importantly, make sure you eat before infections (like lunch or breakfast) and don't have extra coffee/caffine (but if your usual amount doesn't make you shaky then just do what you regularly do)
    - Do NOT do infections if you are not feeling good, are rushed for time, or feel off in some way that will effect how you poke the flies 

### Preparing equitpment beforehand

- Prepare cleaning solutions in individual squeeze bottoles:
    - 10% bleach solution (50mL bleach in 450mL deionized water approximately)
    - Deionized water 
    - 95% ethanol - this is already avaible in the lab and you should refresh this bottle weekly when using because the ethanol absorbs water over time from the air and becomes lower and lower percentages 
- You must use the virus-only CO2 pads for handling of any of your experimental flies 
- To clean the CO2 pad:
    - Place in the white basin handling surface side facing down and fill until sumbmerged with 50% bleach solution 
    - Let the pad soak in the bleach for 10-15 minutes - do not let it soak for longer than 20 minutes or the pad will begin to corrode 
    - Pour out the bleach and turn the pad surface facing upright 
    - Rinse the pad 10+ times very well with deionized water 
    - Attach the CO2 pad to a line to the air nozzles at the lab benches and blow out the water into a paper towel 
    - Use the squeeze bottle of 95% ethanol to coat the pad surface
    - Again use the air line to blow out the ethanol on a paper towel 
    - Let the CO2 pad dry upright or at least 12 hours before using again or putting away in the drawer in the ziploc bag (ie overnight)
- Use autoclaved toothpicks for movement of your flies
- Forceps should be clean before use as well 
    - Soak forceps in small cup in 10% bleach for 2-3 minutes 
    - Rinse in deionized water 10 times
    - Spray with 95 % ethanol and let dry on a paper towel for ~30 minutes before putting away in their ziploc bag 
        - You must let them dry completely with ethanol or they will rust even further 
- Make sure you have at least 3 needles pulled before starting your experiment so you have backups if one breaks 
    - Use the 3.5inch capillary tubes from Drummond 
    - Use the Sutter Instrument Co. P-30 needle puller in the 5th floor equipment room to pull the needles 
    - Make sure the machine is set to 95 for Heat 1 and 78 for Heat 2 
    - Loosen the tabs to hold the tube in place
    - Place the capillary tube in between the notches
    - Tighten the tabs that hold the tube in place (the bottom one slides up)
    - Close the glass
    - Turn on the machine and press pull 
    - Wait 5 seconds after it is finished to take out the needles because the glass will be hot
    - Be careful not to touch the needle tip to anything
    - Store needles in a box with sticky tack so the needle points do not come into contact with anything

### Separating out vials 1-2 days before your exeriment 

- Separate out the planned number of flies to infect into fresh vials 1-2 days before you infect, so that you only have ~10 flies to infect at a time on the CO2 pad (this minimizes flies being on the pad for longer than 10 minutes, which can hurt them)
- For every vial of 10 flies you want to infect, make a vial of ~12 flies just in case some die or some have injuries 
- For vials of males, add a few females in with them to make them happy 
- For vials of females who are supposed to be mated, make sure you add males so you can be sure all the flies are mated 
- For vials of females who are unmated make sure there are never any males with these flies 
- When separating the flies out, make sure to use the virus-only clean CO2 pad and toothpicks for handling. Clean the CO2 pad after use 

### Preparing virus solution right before infection 

- Thaw your single-use aliquot of DiNV solution on ice before using 
    - All virus you use for infections should be aliquoted into single use 0.65mL tubes with ~30ul volume in each. You should never use a virus solution with a different amount of freeze-thaw cycles than your other experiments if you are trying to compare them 
    - Virus stocks should be stored at -80C
- Thaw your single-use aliquot of cell culture medium control solution (or whatever your control solution is) on ice before use as well 
- If you are making dilutions of your virus you should thaw out a larger amount of the diluent 
- All pipetting should use filter tips 
- Diluting DiNV based on Dv-1 cell FFU titers:
    - Know FFU titer of your stock (best to know it in FFU/nL)
    - Know the FFU you want to deliver in a 27.6nL volume
    - Divide your FFU to deliver by 27.6nL to get the concentration you need to dilute your stock to
        - For example, if you want to deliver 1 FFU of virus to your fly with 1 injection, then you need to make a dilution that is 1/27.6 = 0.036 FFU/nL  
    - Depending on the dilution, you may need to dilute your stock something like 1:10 first before further diluting to your desired concentration 
    - Always pipette mix your solutions throughout this process, your stock will not be mixed after thawing. Always pipette mix with 50% of the volume in the tube and mix at least 10 times 
    - Do not vortex and spin down the solutions, only pipette mix 
    - You must try your hardest not to introduce any bubbles into the solutions you will use for injections, the bubbles can get into the needle and cause issues 
    - You must take your time and be careful with these steps 

### Set up for infection 

- Freshly prepare the number of mushroom food vials you will need (see [here](https://github.com/meschedl/Unckless_Lab_Resources/blob/main/protocols/innubila_care_sheet.md) for recipe)
- Wipe down the microscope and area you will be infecting at with 95% ethanol before bringing in any of your other items 
- Bring in: 
    - Virus solutions on ice 
    - Needle box 
    - Toothpicks 
    - Mineral oil 
    - Drummond Nanoject II 
    - Virus CO2 pad 
    - Colored 4-50mL conical holding tube rack 
    - A pair of gloves 
    - p20 pipette and filter tips 
    - Small cup for tip waste
    - 3mL syringe 
- Set up the injector so the box with the buttons is directly next to the scope and on the side where your non-dominate hand is 
- Make sure the injector settings are Up Down Down Up Up (this is for 27.6nL volume injection)
- Bring the curly cord around the back of the microscope and make sure there is as much slack in the cord as you can, rest the tip of the injector on a pen from the fly room (the one with the clip so it doesn't roll) so that the tip where the needle will be does not come into contact with anything 
- Have your separated out flies and new vials close by 
- Set everything up so you have everything within reach, well organized, and you have sufficient space to prepare everything 

### Preparing the needle 

- Take out a needle and look at it under the scope, you will have to zoom in far and it helps if the background is black you can see it stick out better 
- Break the needle with a pair of forceps about mid-way through the tip of the needle, you want the taper to be small but not too small that nothing comes out 
    - This can sometimes not work well and it won't break where you want it to so it's best to have extra needles ready if you need them 
    - Try to create an angle where the tip is broken if you can 
- Backfill the needle with mineral oil 
    - Take the syring and fill up a small amount with mineral oil, dabbing off and wiping with kimwipes the extra oil around the syringe 
    - Hold the syring upright and flick it to make any bubbles come to the top of the opening and push out the bubbles, then wipe excess oil off again 
    - Screw on the thin metal needle from the nanoject kit onto the syring 
    - Push the plunger gently and watch as air comes out of the metal needle in bubbles. Keep gently pushing until there are no bubbles and just oil is coming out 
    - Wipe off the excess oil 
    - Place the metal needle in the end of the glass needle and slide to about 3/4 of the way through - do this with the needles horizontal, it doens't work well vertically
    - Gently push the plunger to add oil to the glass needle, and slowly slide the metal needle back to the opening of the glass needle while filling 
        - If you make an air bubble, get the metal needle in front of the bubble and slowly slide backwards to push the bubble back, keep sliding back and forth if needed to move the bubble back 
        - Try to avoid any bubbles in the oil 
- Once the needle is 3/4th filled with oil, take the black collete (cap over the tip of the injector) and the **first** black washer off the silver tip of the injector 
    - The tip of the injector should have three washers: a black one of the bottom that you do not take off. A white one above the first one that you also do not move, but sometimes it can come off. The white washer has two sides. The side with the larger hole faces up on the injector. The third washer is also black and this one you take off 
- Place the collete onto the glass needle through the back of the needle 
- Place the black washer on the back end of the glass needle, and push it though so it is seated on the needle. You must do this very carefully to not break the needle. Hold the needle in your non-dominant hand nead the needle tip (but don't touch the tip) and the collete should be right after your fingers. Hold gently but firmly to the needle. If you hold to tight you will snap the needle. Gently in a screwing like motion push the washer onto the end of the glass needle. There is one side with a larger hole and use that side to put onto the needle first. You want the washer on the needle so there is about 1mm of glass sticking out the back of the washer once it is on all the way. Be patient and gentle, this can take some time 
- Once the collete and washer are on the glass needle, slide the needle through the metal on the injector tip until the needle is seated at the white washer and then screw the collete down tight. Some mineral oil may come out of the needle tip and you can dab it away with a kimwipe 

### Filling the needle 

- You first must empty the needle of some oil before you can fill it back up 
- Dab the needle tip gently on a kimwipe as you press and hold down the empty button on the button box and watch as oil comes out 
- Empty the needle only about half way - do not empty until the machine stops (maxumum empty position), if you do this you will not be able to clean the needle between solutions 
- Prepare your control solution tube (you must always start with the control flies first)
- Set on the microscope the CO2 pad then the colored 50mL conical rack with the small holes facing up and the larger holes facing towards you 
- Place the 0.65mL tube of control solution in one of the small holes so you can see through the side larger holes into the tube so you can watch the needle go in 
- Place the injector tip with the needle into the solution, fully submerged, but do not touch the needle to the bottom or sides of the tube 
- Press and hold down fill on the button box and fill the needle until it beeps (maximum fill position) or until you think you have enough solution 
- Rest the injector on the pen so that the needle touches nothing 

### Injecting flies 

- Make a table in your notebook (include extra columns if needed):

|vial #| sex| treatment|time|time on CO2| N#|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| _|_ |_ |_ |_ |_ |

- All your control flies will go first, then the DiNV infection flies as to not cross-contaminate through the CO2 pad during in fection
- Place your first set of control flies on the CO2 pad 
- Record the time you placed them on CO2 
- While waiting for the flies to go to sleep you can label your vial 
- Separate out the sex you need from any extra flies using a clean toothpick. Also remove any flies that have broken wings, legs, or any other visuble issue that would make them "sick" already
- Orient the flies the way you like them, it can be easy with their wings facing the top of the pad and have them on their side 
- First look under the scope at the needle tip and inject once in to the air to see that the needle produces a bubble of liquid (not clogged or anything) and dab the bubble away with the toothpick 
- Stablize the fly to infect with the toothpick on their back and poke the needle into their thorax - below and anterior to their wing. You do not need to go in far 
- Once the neele is inside the fly press inject 
- You can feel the injection in the needle
- Once the injection is done, move the fly to the side of the CO2 pad and gently brush it off the needle with the toothpick 
- Repeat for the other 10 flies on the pad 
- If you notice a bubble of liquid come out of the fly when injecting, that means the needle wasn't far in enough, if the bubble resedes back into the fly just wait for that to happen before moving the fly. If the bubble doesn't recede, try pushing the needle in the fly a little bit and see the bubble go in. If the bubble won't go into the fly you will have to discard the fly 
- After all flies are injected, gently brush them into the fresh food vial, cap it, and let them recover on their side for at least 20 minutes 
- Record in your notebook how many minutes the flies were on CO2 (should be less than 10 minutes) and the N# in your vial 
    - If you are having a hard time with the 10 minute time limit, set a timer for 10 minutes once you put the flies on C02 and once it goes off you take the flies off, and however many you have done is just the number you'll have 
- Repeat these steps for all control vials or you run out of control liquid. You should watch the liquid line go down in the needle and stop before you start injecting oil 
- Discard the toothpick in the small cup

### Refilling the needle 

- To change infection solution, press empty on the needle while dabbing it on a kimwipe
    - Watch the liquid come out. The injection solution will come out in drops that will spread on the kimwipe and evaporate quickly 
    - Once your start pushing out the oil it will make shiny droplets that don't spread and don't evaporate
- Empty the needle until you make ~3 oil droplets (again do not empty until the mx of the machine because you won't be able to empty it further)
    - At this point you can be sure all the first solution is out and you can fill with your next one and not diluted it 
- Prepare your next solution, pipette mix at least 10X with 15ul and place in the rack the same as the previous solution 
    - Discard pipette in the small cup
- Fill the needle as above 
- If you are doing multiple dilutions of the virus, make sure you give the most dilute virus fist (higher dilutions) and subsiquently move to more concentrated doses 

### Continuing infections 

- Use a new toothpick for every new injection solution you use 
- Repeat the injection process above for the new fluid 
- Always make sure to monitor the liquid level in the needle in case you need to refill (if you need to refill your virus solution make sure to pipette mix it first before filling)
- Make sure all injected flies are given at least 20 minutes to recover sideways before putting the vials upright. They take a long time to recover after being poked 

### Cleanup after infection 

- Press fill on the button box and hold until the machine beeps, this brings the little silver piece of metal back to its storage position (it is **very important** that you bring the injector back to the "home" position before turning it off)
- Unscrew the collete from the injector tip and remove the needle and place the needle in the sharps container 
- Take out the collete and the first washer and spray with 95% ethanol on a kimwipe 
- Spray a kimwipe with 95% ethanol and wipe down all parts of the injector (do no spray the machine) including the box 
- Wait until the washers have dried from the ethanol before putting them back on and putting the injector away 
- Clean the CO2 pad and forceps as described above 
- Spray ethanol into the cup with the toothpicks and used tips before discarding these items in the glass disposal box 
- Throw out used virus solutions in the autoclave trash 
- Wipe down the bench and microscope station with 95% ethanol 
- Place the _D. innubila_ vials in a rack with your name and date on it and keep it on your shelf (if humidity is very low keep an open tub of water near it)

### Infection monitoring and transferring 

- Prepare a spreadsheet for your experiment will all information and where you will put in daily counts of flies. See example sheet [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dGDrYsXv_4YdU_rGl-owQA-deMOqfBe9VqqTxT6OJOo/edit#gid=0) 
- Count the number of flies alive in each vial every 24 hours for the duration of your experiment and record the data in your spreadsheet
    - For example, if you infected flies from 3-4pm, make sure to count them around 3-4pm each subsiquent day 
- Every 3 days transfer all alive flies to fresh food vials 
- Make fresh mushroom food vials the day of the transfer 
- Use the bleach cleaned CO2 for all transfers, and make sure to clean it after every use 
- Handle vials with the control vials first, then infected, again with the dilutions in order of least to most concentrated to prevent any cross-contamination 
- Dump flies onto the CO2 pad and gently transfer them to new food with a clean toothpick, counting the number of flies as you move them to the new vial
    - We use the CO2 pad to make sure when transferring that the cotton roll does not fall onto the flies and squish any, and that you don't miss any flies who are hiding in any crevises in the vial 
- Change toothpicks for every new treatment 
- Let flies recover for 10 minutes befor placing upright 
- If you are saving dead flies, use the forceps to remove each individual fly into an individual 1.5mL tube
    - Between each fly, dunk the forcepts in a 10% bleach solution, then deionized water to rinse, then 95% ethanol to dry to avoide cross contamination between individual flies as much as possible 
    - Keep track of frozen fly information in a spreadsheet. See example sheet [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11YHJnPTt0k5L4QkxbwPzVZWn_7uOyeqxAMg7YiTKm5I/edit#gid=0)
- If you are keeping flies, at the end of your experiment you should individually freeze all alive flies as well 
- Frozen flies are kept at -20C
