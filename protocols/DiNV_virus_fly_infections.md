## General _D. innubila_ Fly Infection Protocol with DiNV

### Planning Beforehand
- It's best to have a plan beforehand of how many flies you plan to infect, how many to use for control, etc
- Flies should be aged 5-7 days to be used for infecting, a day or two older is ok but not younger
- Only males will be used for infecting, so it can be helpful to pre-make vials a few days before to make sexing easier. However, you don't want to leave only males in a vial when doing this because they will be stressed without females (and thus effect infection). I have had success with pre-making vials with ~12 males, and ~6 females. You will likely loose some to death randomly between the time you separate them and the time you use them so it can be helpful to put in a few more than you plan on needing
- When learning how to infect flies, it can be good practice to do a lot of control flies, however when doing actual experiments, having about 1/3rd the amount of control flies as compared to infection flies is acceptable
- _D. innubila_ flies after infections go on regular mushroom food
- Once you have picked a time to infect (either morning or afternoon), it is best to always stay with the same time. You can have varying poking ability at different times in the day

### Infection Set Up

**Note that it is essential that you follow the steps to keep as sterile and clean an environment as possible. DiNV can easily get on flies and cause issues with controls**

- Make sure the virus CO2 pad has been sterilized before using. If not:
    - Soak the pad in 10% bleach for 20 minutes in a small tray (50mL bleach to 450mL DI H20)
    - Rinse the pad at least 10 times with DI water, and if you have time, add a soak in DI water
    - Use the hose attached to the air by Maggie's bench to blow out the water in the pad, wiping away with a paper towel. Keep the pad upside down. Do this for about a minute 
    - Pour lots of 95% ethanol on the pad and then blow that out as well with the air hose
    - Let the pad dry on the bench overnight
- Make food vials before starting, you should have a planned amount of vials you'll need. See [here](https://github.com/meschedl/Unckless_Lab_Resources/blob/main/protocols/innubila_care_sheet.md) for food vial protocol
- Clean the area around the microscope and the scope with 95% ethanol and wipe with a paper towel
- Bring all components needed to the fly room:
    - Autoclaved toothpicks
    - Sterilized forceps, one for virus and one for control flies (sterilized either by autoclaving or by soaking in bleach, DI, and 95% ethanol)
    - Fresh 95% ethanol squeeze bottle
    - 2 pairs of gloves 
    - Ice bucket with thawing virus and smaller bucket for easy access 
    - A 1.5mL tube filled with fresh 95% ethanol, and place it in a tube rack 
    - Any tubes you need for day 0 flies, get them from your sterile molecular lab stash and close them in the lab first before going into the fly room
- You will start by doing the sterile/control poke flies 
- Make sure everything is set up around you before you start, and you should position it in a way easily accessible for you:
  - Notebook for notes
  - Toothpick laying on a kimwipe or foil 
  - Fresh infection needle, dipped in 95% ethanol, place on the kimwipe or foil
  - Fly vials with your flies aged 5-7 days
  - New vials just made with mushroom food
  - Cotton balls and sharpie if needed
- At this time you will also start making a table in your notebook for keeping track of all this information:

|vial #|treatment|time infected|number of flies|notes|
|---|---|---|---|---|

### Infecting Flies

- Put on gloves
- Tip over the first vial of flies onto the CO2
- While the flies are going to sleep, label your first new food vial with the species, vial number, male, date, and the time (ex 3:24)
- Once the flies have gone to sleep, arrange them in a line across the pad and begin sexing them somewhat quickly, but accurately. Use a sterile toothpick to move the females to the top of the pad and leave the males in a line. If there are any males that look in much worse shape than most (broken or stuck wings), do not use them and move them aside as well. Re-adjust your scope to be very zoomed in and clear on the first fly in the line
- Count how many males you have, if you have more than 10, just infect 10. If you have less then 10 males that will be the number you poke
- You will do all of your control pokes first to be careful to not contaminate the needle or CO2 pad for controls. You will also do all day0 flies at this time 
- Get your control liquid ready and nearby in a rack (could be sterile poke with 95% ethanol dipped needle, or needle dipped in cell culture medium, etc.)
- Hold the toothpick with your non-dominant hand
- Put the needle in your dominant hand
- Look into the scope and do all the positioning of the fly with the probe very gently, you want it to be on its side
- Dip the needle into the liquid, if ethanol, give it a few seconds to dry before poking. If a control fluid is used, put the needle in the fluid just before poking
- Gently poke the fly from a near 90 degree angle in until you are about 1/3 of the way into the fly. This is very hard to tell, and it is different for different sized flies. You want the tape of the needle to go completely in, however the needles are not all 100% alike in shape
- You should poke the flies somewhere between under the wing and the head, it can be easiest to poke through the little seam in their exoskeleton in this circled area:

- Once you have poked, if you pick up the needle the fly will come along with it, place the fly on the corner of the CO2 pad and use the toothpick to gently brush the fly off
- Reposition the CO2 pad for the next fly and repeat
- Count how many flies you are poking until you get to the number you pre-determined to stop for the vial
- If flies are being put into a vial, get your new vial and gently push in the flies with the toothpick. If these flies are being frozen for day 0, use the sterile forceps (for control flies only) to pick up the flies and place them into 1.5mL tubes
- Cotton plug the vial and set it on its side. Flies after being poked take longer to wake up
- Only after you have added all the flies to the vial do you write the N# on the vial (just in case something happens)
- Tap off the females on the CO2 pad into the morgue
- Then you quickly fill out the table in your notebook about those new vial. Make a note if any files were on the CO2 for longer than 10 minutes
- Dip the needle in 95% ethanol between vials
- Repeat the above processes until you have finished with the number of flies needed for control pokes 
- Organize the area for doing the virus infections, get out a new toothpick, the second forceps (now for virus only), put 95% ethanol on the CO2 pad and let it dry with CO2 bubbling for 5 minutes
- Change gloves
- Put the virus tube in the smaller bucket with ice, and lay it so that it is easily accessible by the microscope
- Repeat the same infection process as above 
- While you are waiting for the last vials of flies to wake up, clean the area
- Discard the original vials the flies were in
- Dispose of the needle in the sharps box
- 95% ethanol wipe the area around the microscope again
- Throw out the toothpick and kimwipes/foil
- Put the CO2 pad in the "virus only, needs to be cleaned" ziploc bag, or begin cleaning it (see above)
- Put the infection vials upright in either a test tube rack or a vial box, label with your name, the date, and what is in the box. Leave the _D. innubila_ flies in the fly room, they do not go in the incubator for the duration of the experiment
- Put any day 0 1.5mL tubes in the -20 freezer in a box with an informative label (tubes should be labeled 1-#)
- Throw out the tube with virus in the 4012 to-be-autoclaved bucket

### Monitoring Infection, Transferring, and Freezing
- Flies should be checked every day for at least 14 days
- Write down in your notebook the vial number and the number of flies alive in the vial every day
- Every 3 days you should transfer the flies to new vials, and freeze any dead ones (if needed for experiment)
  - This is done on the CO2 pad, make sure the CO2 pad has been sterilized in time to do this properly 
  - Make new regular mushroom food 
  - Again, do this in the order of all control flies first, then do the virus poked flies 
  - Have 1.5mL tubes from the molecular lab ready and labeled (if needed)
  - Get sterile toothpicks and the sterilized forceps ready
  - Wipe area with 95% ethanol
  - Tip over 1st control vial on the CO2 pad, and use a sterile toothpick to brush the alive flies into a new vial
  - If there are any dead flies you want to freeze, use 1 set of forceps for the control flies to put the fly into a 1.5mL tube. Dip the forceps in 95% ethanol between each fly 
  - Once you have transferred/frozen all control flies, move on to the virus poked flies. Use a different toothpick and the other forceps for moving 
  - Write down in your notebook the name of the tube and the vial it came from for the frozen flies in a table, and put it in a Google Sheet with this info:
    |sample_ID|	vial_from|	sex|	treatment|	day_frozen|	alive_when_frozen?|
    |---|---|---|---|---|---|
  - Once done, throw out the toothpick, sterilize the forceps, and clean the CO2 pad again. Make sure to wipe the area around the scope with 95% ethanol 
- If all flies have died in a vial, you can throw it away after removing all the flies (if needed)
- When you are done with the experiment, you should freeze all the flies (if needed for experiment). Follow the procedure above for putting flies in vials and maintaining sterility
