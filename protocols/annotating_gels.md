# Annotating a Gel in Google Slides

1. Send your phone image to your computer (airdop/email/etc)
2. If it is an HEIC image, convert it to a jpeg, [this is a good website](https://heictojpg.com/)
3. If you want your image to be in black and white, open the image in the default image viewer on your computer (the jpeg version) and convert it to black and white. If you have a Mac and use Preview, go to the tools dropdown and click Adjust Color. Slide the saturation bar all the way to the left to remove the color from the picture.

4. Open up a new Google Slides presentation (or powerpoint), it could be nice to save a presentation specifically for annotating gels
5. Drag in your gel image
6. Crop the image if you want it to be sized better. If there are a lot of unused wells you can crop those out of the picture. Make sure to leave enough space on the left side to include the annotations of the ladder

7. Scale the image back up to take up most of the slide
8. Make text boxes for each well and add the sample name. Use a bright color so it can be seen clearly

9. Identify the ladder you used. **This is very important, find the exact ladder, same brand, online. Not all ladders have the same bands**. This is a commonly used ladder: [Gene Ruler 1kb plus ladder](https://www.thermofisher.com/document-connect/document-connect.html?url=https://assets.thermofisher.com/TFS-Assets%2FLSG%2Fmanuals%2FMAN0013050_GeneRuler_1kb_Plus_DNALadder_RTU_50ug_UG.pdf),. Make sure you find the technical document that goes with the product where they give you the band sizes.
10. Create text boxes in the gel next to the band sizes (similar to the reference images). You do not need to add every size, just ones that are relevant. For an extraction gel, the band sizes at the top are more relevant to assessing how large the DNA is. For a PCR amplicon gel, the band sizes around the target band are more relevant. Example of an extraction gel:

11. If you want to add the date to the gel you can by adding another text box
11. Take a screenshot of the finished gel (if you want it large you can screenshot from presentation mode) and save that as your finished gel. If you did not put the date as an annotation in the image, make sure to put the date in the name when you save the image. A lot of gels can look alike
