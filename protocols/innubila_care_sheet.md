# Maggie's Care Guide for _Drosophila innubila_

### Making Food

- _D. innubila_ flies are mushroom feeders, which means their food is a combination of instant drosophila medium and grocery store white mushrooms
- It's easiest to make all the food vials for the day in bulk, set up as many vials are needed in a test tube rack (or two)
- Food is in a red lidded tub on the shelf above the sink, along with a funnel and a measuring spoon
- Put the funnel in the first vial
- Use the larger of the spoons for measuring, overfill it generously and dump into the funnel
- You will often need to tap the funnel down a few times to get the food to fall into the vial
- Move the funnel to the next vial, and add food the same way
- Repeat for all vials
- Try your best not to get food powder on the outside of the vials if possible
- Rinse the measuring spoon and funnel with water before placing back on the shelf
- Make sure the lid is on tight of the tub when you put it away
- Pick up the rack and tap it out on the counter to get any food flakes to fall off, and brush them into the sink
- Fill one of the plastic beakers up with tap water
- Place the hose with the glass end at the bottom of the beaker
- Wedge the empty beaker in the one with water to hold the hose down at the bottom
- Make sure the other hose is set to the open end in the sink
- Turn on the water dispensing machine from the switch on the back
- Once the screen is on, press the ok button
- Then press the "play" button (on the right side)
- It will start pumping water though, wait until there are no air bubbles in the hose before using on the vials
- Dispense 2 pumps of water into each vial
- If it stops in the middle of dispensing, press the play button again
- When you're done with every vial put the dispensing hose back in the sink and take the hose with the glass end out of the water
- Wait until the machine pumps out all of the water in the hoses, then turn off the machine with the switch in the back
- Use a piece of press-n-seal to cover up the vials while you cut mushrooms, this protects them from any flies in the room and lets them set up
- Get mushrooms from the fridge in the lab
- Cut the mushroom in half, then you can easily take the stem out
- Then peel off the outer layer of the cap - this can contain nematodes that we don't want in the food
- Cut the mushroom half in half again length-wise, then cut each piece into 3-6 squarish even pieces (this number depends on the size of the mushroom)
  - You want the piece to take up ~1/3 to 1/4 of the space inside the vial if you are looking directly down into it
- Cut 1 mushroom piece for each vial
- If you have additional vials that you are saving for larvae to grow into adults after transferring, cut 1 new mushroom piece for each as well
- Get a wheel of cotton rolls from the box on the shelves above the stock flies
- For each new vial add 1 cotton roll (push down to be half in the food) and 1 mushroom piece (push down into the food the same way)
- Cover up the food with the press-n-seal again
- Seal the extra mushroom pieces in a pouch of press-n-seal to protect from escaped flies
- Clean the knife and cutting board with soap and water
- Clean the counter top with soap and water to remove any powdered food residue

### Making New Vials and Transferring Vials

- _D. innubila_ flies will emerge about 2 weeks after being laid. You will want to wait until a lot of flies emerge in a vial before transferring them to a new one. I have found that they are best kept at high density (~40 flies per vial)
- New vials of flies are labeled with "N" and contain flies that have just been transferred from the emergence vial. Label the vial _D. innubila_ genome, the date, and "N"
- Set up a new vial with a new cotton ball at hand. Take the vial with the emerged flies and start twisting in your hand.
- Most of the flies should drop to the bottom of the vial
- Tap the vial once or twice on the bench to get all the flies to fall, still twisting
- With your other hand start to pull out the cotton ball plug
- Swiftly take out the plug and flip the vial vertically over the new vial and tap the flies out of the old into the new. Be gentle at tapping so the old cotton rolls don't fall out
- Be patient because not all the flies will come out of the old vial quickly
- When you have transferred enough flies, tap down the bottom vial and release the top vial
- Cap the bottom vial immediately with the new cotton ball
- Cap the old vial secondarily with the old cotton ball
- Throw out the old vial into the fly trash
- Leave this vial for 3-4 days in the fly room. I have had good success transferring flies on Tuesdays and Fridays of every week
- After 3-4 days, the flies will need to go into a fresh food vial
- Repeat the process above for transferring the flies to their new vial. This time, label the vial with a "2" instead of an "N"
- **Throw out the "N" vials after you have transferred the flies**. _D. innubila_ will hardly lay any eggs this early on in their life. It is not worth wasting the space in your boxes for vials that will not produce anything
- Again wait another 3-4 days and these flies are ready to go to there "3" vials
- Repeat the transfer process from the "2" vials to "3" vials
- **This time, save the "2" vials**
- After you have transferred the flies out, each "2" vial gets a new cotton roll and a new mushroom piece as extra food for the larval flies. The cotton roll is there to attenuate the humidity
- Push the cotton roll and mushroom down into the vial the same as in a new vial
- You might see hairs of fungus growing already in the vials, this is normal. Only when it takes over the whole flask will it not produce any flies. Usually at least 1 out of every 10 vials will get overrun by fungal growth. The more larvae in the vial the less fungal growth
- Repeat the same for further passages, giving the larvae extra mushroom and cotton roll
- You should keep "2", "3", "4", and even "5" type vials for producing flies. I usually dump the adult flies in the morgue after they are finished in the "4" vials
- When you no longer want to keep passaging the adults, dump the vial over into the morgue and gently tap out the flies. Be careful not to lose either a cotton roll or a mushroom
- New flies will emerge about 2 weeks from when you put the parents in

### Other Notes
- _D. innubila_ do not like CO2, if you have to knock them out to sex them, do not expect them to reproduce well for another 2 days after that
- They only lay well closely confined and crowded in the small mating cages
- They prefer agar plates made with apple juice, mushroom broth, and sugar
- They do not like yeast paste
