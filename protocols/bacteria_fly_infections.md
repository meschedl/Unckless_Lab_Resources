## General _D. melanogaster_ Fly Infection Protocol with Bacteria


**Note: This is just the infection process protocol. You will need to have grown bacteria overnight in liquid cultures, used the spectrophotometer to get it to the right OD, and have flies aged properly.**


### Planning Beforehand
- It's best to have a plan beforehand of how many flies you plan to infect, how many to use for control, etc
- Flies should be aged 5-7 days to be used for infecting, a day or two older is ok but not younger
- Usually only males will be used for infections. Decide if you are going to do males or females for your infections. Usually you keep stock vials of flies with 20+ flies in them. Because you do infections in sets of 10, it can be helpful to pre-make vials a few days before with fewer numbers of flies, and set ratios of sexes. 
  - If you want to infect 20 males and control poke 20 males, you can set up 4 vials a day or two before with ~11 males in each. However, you don't want to leave only males in a vial when doing this because they will be stressed without females (and thus effect infection). You can add 4 females to a group of 11 males. If you are separating out females, they do not need any males and you can pre set up vials of ~11 females. You add a few more flies than you need just in case any die or fly away when putting on the CO2 pad 
- When learning how to infect flies, it can be good practice to do a lot of control flies (LB), however when doing actual experiments, having about 1/3rd to 1/4th the amount of control flies as compared to infection flies is acceptable
- Once you have picked a time to infect (either morning or afternoon), it is best to always stay with the same time. You can have varying poking ability at different times in the day


### Infection Set Up

- Clean the area around the microscope and the scope with 95% or 70% ethanol and wipe with a paper towel
- Turn on the CO2 if it's not on already
- Wipe the CO2 pad with ethanol and a kim wipe and turn on the open the CO2 valve to so that the air flow dries the CO2 pad, about 30 seconds, then turn it off
- Get a 1.5mL tube, fill it with 95% ethanol, and place it in the tube rack with your bacteria tubes
- Place 2 layers of kim wipes in front of the microscope
- Dip a probe tool and a fresh needle into the 95% ethanol and place on those kim wipes to dry
- Make sure everything is set up around you before you start, and you should position it in a way easily accessible for you:
  - Notebook for notes
  - Bacteria and LB tubes in a rack
  - Fly vials with your flies aged 5-7 days
  - New molasses food vials 
  - Cotton balls, sharpie, and feather brush
- Prepare the first food vial, you want to write the species and line of fly, the date, and the treatment the flies get (either LB or the bacteria concentration)
- At this time you will also start making a table in your notebook for keeping track of all this information:

|vial #|treatment|time infected|number of flies|notes|
|---|---|---|---|---|

### Infecting Flies

- Tip over the first vial of flies onto the CO2 and write the time on the vials
- Once the flies have gone to sleep, arrange them in a line across the pad and begin sexing them somewhat quickly, but accurately. Brush the females/extra flies to the top of the pad and leave the sex to infect in a line. If there are any flies that look in much worse shape than most (broken or stuck wings), do not use them and brush them aside as well. Re-adjust your scope to be very zoomed in and clear on the first fly in the line
- It's best to vary the order of the infection liquid. This means that not all the LB or the bacteria infections are done in a row. You can have varying poking ability over the time you infect
- Pick your first infection liquid and invert the tube at least 1 time (even for LB)
- Hold the probe between your middle and index fingers on your non-dominant hand. Also hold the infection liquid tube open between your index and thumb on your non-dominant hand
- Put the needle in your dominant hand
- Look into the scope and do all the positioning of the fly with the probe very gently, you want it to be on its side
- Dip the needle into the infection liquid just before poking if possible
- Gently poke the fly from a near 90 degree angle in until you are about 1/3 of the way into the fly. This is very hard to tell, and it is different for different sized flies. You want the tape of the needle to go completely in, however the needles are not all 100% alike in shape
- You should poke the flies somewhere between under the wing and the head, it can be easiest to poke through the little seam in their exoskeleton in this circled area:

- Once you have poked, if you pick up the needle the fly will come along with it, place the fly on the corner of the CO2 pad and use the probe to gently brush the fly off
- Dip the needle back into the infection liquid and adjust the CO2 pad position to put the next fly in view
- Count how many flies you are poking until you get to the number you pre-determined to stop for the vial
- Dip the needle and the probe in the 95% ethanol and place them back on the kim wipe (even if you are not switching infection liquids this is good practice)
- Get your new vial and gently brush in the infected flies with a feather brush
- Cotton plug the vial and set it on its side. Flies after being poked take longer to wake up
- Only after you have added all the flies to the vial do you write the N# on the vial (just in case something happens)
- Brush any extra flies off into the morgue
- Then you quickly fill out the table in your notebook about those new vial(s). Make a note if any files were on the CO2 for longer than 10 minutes
- Repeat the above processes until you have finished with the number of flies you wanted to infect or you run out of flies
- While you are waiting for the last vials of flies to wake up, clean the area
- You can either keep or discard the original vials the flies were in
- Ethanol the probe before putting it back in the drawer
- Dispose of the needle in the sharps box
- Ethanol wipe the area around the microscope again, and wipe the CO2 pad and let it dry with the gas on
- Put the infection vials upright in either a test tube rack or a vial box, label with your name, the date, and what is in the box. For melanogaster flies with bacteria infections, keep them in the 23C incubator for the durration of the infection. 
- Return the tube rack to 4012 and dispose of the bacteria tubes in the autoclave trash bin

### Monitoring Infection
- Keep flies in the 23C incubator 
- Flies should be checked every day for 7 days at around the same time you infected (about 24hrs)
- Write down in your notebook the vial number and the number of flies alive in the vial every day
- Every 3 days you should transfer the flies to new molasses vials
- Once all the flies have died in a vial you can throw the vial away in the fly trash
- After the 7 days you can discard all the vials in the fly trash
