## General PCR Protocol


If you need to know the stock number of any PCR primers, they can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vfDktFls59j00b1W20Qap9NiGcbgTu3IGnMbQrz4gxs/edit#gid=0)  
**Specific instructions on PCR cycling conditions, band sizes, and gel conditions for primers Maggie uses are found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1IaLLjsa4SXJr90wUi8xyE1dYvWmHsbThSz3d8N9KaK0/edit#gid=0)**

**General knowledge**
- PCR reactions should be set up on ice, with all reagents and samples being thawed on ice
- Every set of reactions you do should have a positive and negative control. A positive control is a reaction with DNA from a sample you know will amplify for your specific primers. A negative control is a reaction that has water instead of DNA. These will tell you if your reaction mix works properly and if things are contaminated
- Make sure to sign up for a PCR machine on the calendar for when you need them

**Steps**
- Calculate the _n_ number for your reactions:
  - _n_ = # of samples + 2 + 0.1% for error
  - Example: _n_ = 10 + 2 + 1 = 13
- Calculate components to make a master mix. A master mix will contain all things needed for the PCR reaction except the DNA. This way each reaction will get the same reaction liquid and there is less variability across samples.
  - 5ul GoTaq mix * _n_ =
  - 0.25ul forward primer * _n_ =
  - 0.25ul reverse primer * _n_ =
  - 3.5ul molecular grade water * _n_ =
- Combine all reagents into a tube on ice
- Vortex and spin down the master mix
- Set up strip tubes for each sample and the controls
- Label tubes with sample #s, some indication of the primer, and the date
- Add 9ul of the master mix to each strip tube
- Vortex and spin down all DNA samples
- Add 1ul of DNA from each sample to their respective reaction tube
- Add 1ul of molecular grade water to the negative control tube
- Add 1ul of the positive control DNA to the positive control tube
- Vortex all strip tubes and spin them down
- Turn on your scheduled PCR machine and navigate to the PCR program needed
- Place the strip tubes in the machine (making sure the caps are on securely, that the green rack is on the correct side, and that all tubes are in holders)
- Close the lid and start the program. The volume is 10ul
- The machine will tell you the run time
- At the end of the program the samples are held at 12C, but they should be taken out and placed in the 4C storage on a red rack (labeled) as soon as possible so the machine can be turned off and save energy
