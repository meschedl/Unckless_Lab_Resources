### Single Fly DNA Extraction Protocol in Single Tubes

The general steps of a DNA extraction are: 
1. Homogenization - break open hard tissue to access cells (exoskeleton)
2. Cell lysis - break open cells to access nuclei, mitochondria, and the genome
3. Protein/RNA/debris removal - removal of all other cellular components while leaving DNA in solution
4. DNA purification - separating out DNA from the extraction solution and eulting it in a solution suitable for downstream use

Read [this](https://www.promega.com/resources/guides/nucleic-acid-analysis/dna-purification/) for more information on steps of DNA extraction, what they mean, and what methods are out there for extraction. This protocol is an alcohol precipitation based method.

This protocol uses a [Puregene DNA Purification Kit from Qiagen](https://www.qiagen.com/us/products/discovery-and-translational-research/dna-rna-purification/dna-purification/genomic-dna/puregene-kits/?catno=158043) for all reagents and methods, except for RNase A which is purchased separately from [Qiagen](https://www.qiagen.com/us/products/discovery-and-translational-research/lab-essentials/enzymes/rnase-a/).

Other materials:
- 70% ethanol (100% ethanol and molecular grade water)
- 100% isopropanol
- 1.5mL centrifuge tubes
- Kimwipes
- Ice bucket and ice
- Autoclave-sterilized homogenization pestles
- Pestle grinding devise 
- p200, p20, and p2 pipettes and tips


Users should start out with single flies in individual 1.5mL tubes that have been frozen at -20C since collection.

Aliquots of kit solutions can be made if many users are using the kit as to avoid contamination. Pour or pipette yourself 15-50mL aliquots of cell lysis solution, protein precipitation solution, and DNA hydration solution. Keep these labeled and sterile.

Use sterile technique and avoid contamination of samples throughout this process. 

**Homogenization**

1. Chill the cell lysis solution on ice until it becomes cloudy. This may take ~30 minutes
2.  Make sure the heat blocks are turned on to 65C and 37C (or the incubator oven is at 65C if you are doing more than 24 samples - note that you have to set the incubator oven to ~70C to get it to be 65C)
3. Keep fly samples on ice 
4. While on ice, add 100ul of cell lysis solution to each fly tube
5. Homogenize each fly with the motorized pestle for ~5 seconds each. The fly should fully breakup, it can help to move the pestle up and down a little in the tube to make sure the fly gets broken up. Each fly gets a new pestle, and pestles should be bleached and autoclaved before using
6. Keep pestles until you are finished and clean then afterwards
7. Use the mini-centrifuge to briefly spin down the homogenized fly tubes

**Lysis**

8. Incubate tubes in the heat block for 15 minutes at 65 degrees C
9. While tubes are incubating, make a dilution of RNase A from 100mg/mL to 1mg/mL by doing a 1:100 dilution, 1ul in 99ul molecular grade water. Keep this on ice while in use. Do not store diluted RNase A for further use because it is no longer in its storage buffer
10. After incubation, let tubes cool to room temp
11. Add 2ul of the diluted RNase A to each tube
12. Invert tubes to mix 25 times by flipping the tube rack over and over, this way all tubes get mixed the same number of times
13/ Use the mini-centrifuge to briefly spin down the tubes after mixing
13. Incubate tubes at 37 degrees C for 40 minutes in either the heat block or the incubator oven
14. While this is incubating, you can prepare the final tubes. Make 1 new 1.5L tube for each sample and add 100ul of fresh 100% isopropanol to each tube. Then label the tubes: on the lid label with the sample number/ID and "DNA", on the side, repeat the sample number/ID, DNA, the date, and your initials
15. Additionally while the samples are incubating, make fresh 70% ethanol by mixing 35mL of 100% ethanol with 15mL molecular grade water for a 50mL conical, or 10.5mL of 100% ethanol with 4.5mL of molecular grade water for a 15mL conical
16. Cool tubes to room temperature

**Protein and debris removal**

17. Add 33ul of protein precipitation solution to each tube
18. Vortex tubes for 10 seconds each
19. Place tubes on ice for 5 minutes
20. Centrifuge tubes at ~14,000rpm for 3 minutes (maximum speed in small centrifuges)

**DNA precipitation and purification**

21. After centrifugation, transfer the supernatant to the final tubes with isopropanol in them. Be very careful to not pipette up any debris in the pellet. The volume will be close to 130ul
22. Invert tubes gently 50 times to mix by flipping the tube rack over and over
23. Centrifuge tubes ~14,000rpm for 5 minutes, making sure to put all tubes in the centrifuge with the hinge of the caps facing out of the centrifuge. This way the "back" of the tube is where the pelleted DNA gets pushed to
24. Check all tubes for a DNA pellet - this may not be visible, but you should still "act" like a pellet is there because sometimes the DNA is not enough to see
25. Discard supernatant by pouring the liquid off away from the pellet gently. This waste is not hazardous and can be rinsed down the sink after the process, it is easiest to pour into a cup and rinse later
26. Add 100ul freshly prepared 70% ethanol to each tube
27. Invert tubes ~2 times to mix
28. Centrifuge tubes ~14,000rpm 1 minute, again with the hinge of the cap facing out of the centrifuge
29. Discard supernatant by pouring the liquid off away from the pellet gently
30. Let tubes dry on the benchtop by inverting on a kim wipe for 30 minutes to 1 hour
31. Resuspend pellets in 20ul DNA hydration solution (or other desired volume. The less volume you use the more concentrated the DNA will be)
32. Let DNA resuspend overnight on the benchtop
33. The next day, freeze DNA at -20C if not using right away
34. DNA can be used to check concentration (Qubit) or directly into a PCR
