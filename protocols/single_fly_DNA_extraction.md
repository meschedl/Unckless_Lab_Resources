### Single Fly DNA Extraction Protocol

The general steps of a DNA extraction are: 1. homogenization, 2. cell lysis, 3. protein/RNA/debris removal, and 4. DNA purification.

This protocol uses a [Puregene DNA Purification Kit from Qiagen](https://www.qiagen.com/us/products/discovery-and-translational-research/dna-rna-purification/dna-purification/genomic-dna/puregene-kits/?catno=158043) for all reagents and methods, except for RNase A which is purchased separately from [Qiagen](https://www.qiagen.com/us/products/discovery-and-translational-research/lab-essentials/enzymes/rnase-a/).

Users should start out with single flies in individual 1.5mL tubes that have been frozen at -20C since collection.

Aliquots of kit solutions can be made if many users are using the kit as to avoid contamination.

**Homogenization**
- Chill the cell lysis solution on ice until it becomes cloudy
- Make sure the heat blocks are turned on to 65C and 37C (or the incubator oven is at 65C if you are doing more than 24 samples)
- Keep fly samples on ice
- While on ice, add 100ul of cell lysis solution to each fly tube
- Homogenize each fly with the motorized pestle for ~5 seconds each. The fly should fully breakup, it can help to move the pestle up and down a little in the tube to make sure the fly gets broken up. Each fly gets a new pestle, and pestles should be bleached and autoclaved before using
- Keep pestles until you are finished and clean then afterwards
- Use the mini-centrifuge to briefly spin down the homogenized fly tubes

**Lysis**
- Incubate tubes in the heat block for 15 minutes at 65 degrees C
- Make a dilution of RNase A from 100mg/mL to 1mg/mL by doing a 1:100 dilution, 1ul in 99ul molecular grade water
- After incubation, let tubes cool to room temp
- Add 2ul of the diluted RNase A to each tube
- Invert tubes to mix 25 times by flipping the tube rack over and over, this way all tubes get mixed the same number of times
- Use the mini-centrifuge to briefly spin down the tubes after mixing
- Incubate tubes at 37 degrees C for 40 minutes in either the heat block or the incubator oven
- While this is incubating, you can prepare the final tubes. Make 1 new 1.5L tube for each sample and add 100ul of fresh 100% isopropanol to each tube. Then label the tubes: on the lid label with the sample number/ID and "DNA", on the side, repeat the sample number/ID, DNA, the date, and your initials
- Additionally while the samples are incubating, make fresh 70% ethanol by mixing 35mL of 100% ethanol with 15mL molecular grade water
- Cool tubes to room temperature

**Protein and debris removal**
- Add 33ul of protein precipitation solution to each tube
- Vortex tubes for 10 seconds each
- Place tubes on ice for 5 minutes
- Centrifuge tubes at ~14,000rpm for 3 minutes

**DNA precipitation and purification**
- After centrifugation, transfer the supernatant to the final tubes with isopropanol in them. Be very careful to not pipette up any debris in the pellet. The volume will be close to 130ul
- Invert tubes gently 50 times to mix by flipping the tube rack over and over
- Centrifuge tubes ~14,000rpm for 5 minutes, making sure to put all tubes in the centrifuge in a specific orientation
- Check all tubes for a DNA pellet - this may not be visible
- Discard supernatant by pouring the liquid off away from the pellet
- Add 100ul freshly prepared 70% ethanol to each tube
- Invert tubes ~2 times to mix
- Centrifuge tubes ~14,000rpm 1 minute
- Discard supernatant by pouring the liquid off away from the pellet
- Let tubes dry on the benchtop by inverting on a kim wipe for 30 minutes to 1 hour
- Resuspend pellets in 20ul DNA hydration solution
- Let DNA resuspend overnight on the benchtop
- The next day, freeze DNA at -20C if not using right away
- DNA can be used to check concentration (Qubit) or directly into a PCR
