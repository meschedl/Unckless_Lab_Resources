## DNA extraction from cell culture samples

This protocol uses a [Puregene DNA Purification Kit from Qiagen](https://www.qiagen.com/us/products/discovery-and-translational-research/dna-rna-purification/dna-purification/genomic-dna/puregene-kits/?catno=158043) for all reagents and methods, except for RNase A which is purchased separately from [Qiagen](https://www.qiagen.com/us/products/discovery-and-translational-research/lab-essentials/enzymes/rnase-a/).

Other materials:
- 70% ethanol (100% ethanol and molecular grade water)
- 100% isopropanol
- 1.5mL centrifuge tubes
- Kimwipes
- Ice bucket and ice
- p200, p20, and p2 pipettes and **filter** tips

This protocol is for DNA extraction from cells in fluid or cell culture supernatants. Samples should be 1.5mL tubes with 50ul of sample fluid in each. **If your samples will be used for the purposes of qPCR, 1ul of 1:1000 diluted lambda DNA should be added to every sample before DNA extraction. This will be a control for qPCR reactions.**

**If you are extracting DNA from DiNV infected cells, and you have control samples to compare it to, it is best to follow these guidelines for planning extraction order**

- With most lab processes where you have to process a lot of samples in batches, you would randomize the order samples get prepared in. However, because of the concern of contamination of viral DNA, **your samples have to be ordered in a very specific order for this type of DNA extraction**
- If you have a small number of samples (typically less than 48), you can do them all in one day of extraction. You should order your samples will all of the control samples first, and all of your virus samples second 
- If you have more samples to do than in one day of extraction, split up your controls and virus infected samples into groups based on how many rounds of extractions you will do. You should order the samples you will be extracting on each day with controls first, then virus infected samples
- Additionally, for every day you do an extraction, you should include two extraction controls. These are empty tubes that get treated like they have a cells in them, and get the whole process done to them. This can help you identify contamination. Make one extraction control tube your first tube you extract, and the other one should be the last tube you extract 
- For example, you should have a set of samples that looks like this:

| tube                 | treatment |
|----------------------|-----------|
| extraction control 1 | NA        |
| 1                    | control   |
| 2                    | control   |
| 3                    | control   |
| 4                    | control   |
| 5                    | control   |
| 6                    | infection |
| 7                    | infection |
| 8                    | infection |
| 9                    | infection |
| 10                   | infection |
| extraction control 2 | NA |


### Extraction Steps

Note that filter tips are used for all pipetting!! 

1. Chill the cell lysis solution on ice until it becomes cloudy. This may take ~30 minutes
2.  Make sure the heat blocks are turned on to 65C and 37C (or the incubator oven is at 65C if you are doing more than 24 samples - note that you have to set the incubator oven to ~71C to get it to be 65C)
5. Thaw samples on ice 
4. Add 250ul of chilled cell lysis solution to each tube and pipette mixed 10X
5. Incubate tubes in the heat block at 65C for 10 minutes
6. While tubes are incubating, make a dilution of RNase A to 1mg/mL. Stock lab solutions may be at 100mg/mL or 10mg/mL. Only make about what you need. Do not store diluted RNase A for further use because it is no longer in its storage buffer. 3ul of diluted RNase A is needed per tube. Vortex and spin down RNase A after making the dilution
7. Let tubes come to room temperature 
8. Add 3ul of RNase A to each sample tube
9. Invert tubes 25 times to mix 
10. Inucbate sample tubes at 37C for 30 minutes (either in the heat block or in the oven)
11. While this is incubating, you can prepare the final tubes. Make 1 new 1.5L tube for each sample and add 100ul of fresh 100% isopropanol to each tube. Then label the tubes: on the lid label with the sample number/ID and "DNA", on the side, repeat the sample number/ID, DNA, the date, and your initials
12. Additionally while the samples are incubating, make fresh 70% ethanol by mixing 35mL of 100% ethanol with 15mL molecular grade water for a 50mL conical, or 10.5mL of 100% ethanol with 4.5mL of molecular grade water for a 15mL conical
13. Cool tubes to room temperature on the bench
14. Add 100ul of protein precipitation solution to each tube
15. Vortex tubes for 10 seconds each
16. Place tubes on ice for 5 minutes
17. Centrifuge tubes at ~14,000rpm for 3 minutes (maximum speed in small centrifuges). If you have more than 24 samples this has to be done in 2 batches
18. Transfer the supernatant from the centrifugation (~400ul) to the new tubes with the isopropanol and discard the old tubes
19. Invert the new tubes 50 times to mix the samples
20. Centrifuge tubes ~14,000rpm for 5 minutes, making sure to put all tubes in the centrifuge with the hinge of the caps facing out of the centrifuge. This way the "back" of the tube is where the pelleted DNA gets pushed to
21. Check all tubes for a DNA pellet - this will likely not be visible in cell samples, but you should still "act" like a pellet is there because the DNA is not enough to see
22. Discard supernatant by pouring the liquid off away from the pellet gently. This waste is not hazardous and can be rinsed down the sink after the process, it is easiest to pour into a cup and rinse later
23. Add 100ul freshly prepared 70% ethanol to each tube
24. Invert tubes ~2 times to mix
25. Centrifuge tubes ~14,000rpm 1 minute, again with the hinge of the cap facing out of the centrifuge
26. Discard supernatant by pouring the liquid off away from the pellet gently
27. Let tubes dry on the benchtop by inverting on a kim wipe for 30 minutes to 1 hour
28. Resuspend pellets in 20ul DNA hydration solution (or other desired volume. The less volume you use the more concentrated the DNA will be)
29. Let DNA resuspend overnight on the benchtop
30. The next day, freeze DNA at -20C if not using right away
31. DNA can be used to check concentration (Qubit) or directly into a PCR
