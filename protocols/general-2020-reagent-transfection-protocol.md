## General 2020 Reagent Cell Transfection Protocol


### Using the [Mirus Bio TransIT 2020 Transfection Reagent](https://www.mirusbio.com/products/transfection/transit-2020-transfection-reagent) to transfet a plasmid into _Drosophila_ cells. Note that this protocol is written for cells in a 12-well plate. Volumes may be different if a different plate is used, use the [company protocol](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1IJ2xDEYB8KlSuMu3N0QT9lFtIJYDjYu0/view?usp=share_link) to determine specifications. Additionally, this protocol uses 1ul of 2020 reagent per well as the volume. This has been determined to be the best reagent volume for Dv-1 and S2 cells. If you are doing other cells, different ratios of reagent to plasmid may need to be optimized.


**Preparing plasmid**
- You must prepare your plasmid through an endotoxin-free method so that it is suitable for transfection. This is achieved by doing a [plasmid midi-prep kit extraction](https://www.qiagen.com/us/products/discovery-and-translational-research/dna-rna-purification/dna-purification/plasmid-dna/qiagen-plasmid-kits?catno=12143), such as using the Qiagen kit
    - This method may need to be optimized, based on the copy number of your plasmid 
- Plasmid DNA must be normalized to 1ug per ul concentration (1000ng/ul) before use in transfection

**Preparing cells**
- 24 hours before transfection, plate your cells (to the best of your ability) at 1.5*10^5 cells/mL
- Use the hemocytometer to measure density of cells, and dilute for plating 
- Each well in the 12 well plate should have 1.5mL of medium in it 
- Keep the cells in the incubator overnight 

**Transfecting cells**
- All processes are done in the cell culture hood 
- All pipetting is done with filter tips and sterile technique is used
- Thaw 1ug/ul plasmid DNA and TransIT 2020 reagent at room temperature, vortex and spin them down before use 
- Warm cell culture medium (no serum or antibiotics) in the hood to room temp
- Determine number of wells getting what reaction. For controls, only cell culture medium is used (previous transfections show no difference between a control with reagent or without) 
    - Need to know number of control wells 
    - Need to know number of wells getting 2020 reagent and plasmid 
- Prepare a 1.5mL tube with 100ul of cell culture medium for each control well (ex. 4 controls, 400ul medium)
- Prepare a 1.5ml tube for the reagent plasmid mix. In it put:
    - 100ul cell culture medium per well
    - 1ul of 1ug/ul plasmid DNA per well 
    - 1ul of TransIT 2020 reagent per well
- Gently pipette mix the solution in the 1.5mL tube at least 10 times - note that the liquid can become opaque and that is normal 
- Leave the 1.5mL tube of reagent and plasmid in the cell culture hood at room temp for 30 minutes to let the liposome complexes form 
- After the 30 minutes, add the solutions to your wells. When adding the solution, let droplets out of the pipette over all areas of the well:
    - Gently drop 100ul of cell culture medium over each control well 
    - Gently drop 102ul of the plasmid/reagent mix over each experimental well
- Gently rock the plate back and forth to try to distribute the liquid over the wells evenly 
- Place the lid back on and leave in the 23C incubator overnight 
- Image each well every 24 hours for up to 6 days to monitor transfection
